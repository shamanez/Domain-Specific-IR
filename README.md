# Domain-Specific-IR
Information retrieval improved by a lot over the last year specially with pretrained language models.  But the main bottleneck is scarcity of domain specific QA pairs.

## This repositary closely look at unsupervised IR specially in relation to QA.

### By carefully analysing the previous work, we identfied three main areas of work. 

* Craeting systems with exisiting IR models and collect data when users are interacting with them. Later such data get used to fine-tune systems.
* Synthetic QA pair generation.
* Concider already avaiable meta data in documents as user quaries and answers to train a system.
